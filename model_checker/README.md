This a basic model checker implementation to represents interleaved capture and update operations.

The point of the model checker is to run all possible interleaves and identify variations in the resulting state of the system.

This augments the purely functional (input/output) predicates of the original ALGT, in order to model dynamic behavior.  

In conjunction with domain driven design and event sourcing, this is possibly a quite powerful way of validating system behavior.
